## OBJECT-DETECTION-TEACHABLE-MACHINE

The **OBJECT-DETECTION-TEACHABLE-MACHINE** project is an educational implementation of object detection using Google's Teachable Machine platform. This README provides an overview of the project, including its purpose, features, usage instructions, and examples.
The OBJECT-DETECTION-TEACHABLE-MACHINE project is an educational exploration of building custom object detection models using Google's Teachable Machine platform. This project enables users to create, train, and deploy object detection models without the need for complex programming, making it accessible and interactive for learners and enthusiasts interested in machine learning and computer vision.

Project Objective
The primary objective of the OBJECT-DETECTION-TEACHABLE-MACHINE project is to introduce users to the concept of object detection through hands-on experience with Teachable Machine. 
### Project Overview

The **OBJECT-DETECTION-TEACHABLE-MACHINE** project aims to demonstrate how to create a custom object detection model using Teachable Machine, a web-based tool for training machine learning models without writing code. This project enables users to build and deploy a simple object detection model capable of recognizing custom classes of objects.

### Key Features and Functionality

- **Custom Object Detection**:
  - Enables the creation of a custom object detection model to recognize specific classes of objects chosen by the user.

- **Teachable Machine Integration**:
  - Utilizes Google's Teachable Machine platform to train and export the object detection model without the need for complex programming.

- **Educational Purpose**:
  - Serves as an educational resource for learning about object detection, machine learning, and model deployment.

### Prerequisites

Before using the **OBJECT-DETECTION-TEACHABLE-MACHINE** project, ensure you have the following:

- A modern web browser (Google Chrome recommended)
- Access to the internet to use the Teachable Machine platform

### Usage Instructions

1. **Access Teachable Machine**:
   - Visit the [Teachable Machine website](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) using a web browser.

2. **Create a New Project**:
   - Click on "Get Started" and choose "Image Project" to create a new project for object detection.

3. **Gather Training Data**:
   - Collect images of different objects you want to detect and categorize into custom classes (e.g., apples, oranges, bananas).

4. **Train the Model**:
   - Upload your images to Teachable Machine and train the object detection model by assigning labels to each class.

5. **Export the Model**:
   - Export the trained model from Teachable Machine as a TensorFlow.js model or a TensorFlow Lite model for deployment.

6. **Integrate the Model**:
   - Incorporate the exported model into your web or mobile application to perform real-time object detection.

### Project Structure

The **OBJECT-DETECTION-TEACHABLE-MACHINE** project primarily consists of the following components:

- **Teachable Machine Interface**:
  - Provides a web-based interface for uploading images, training the model, and exporting the trained object detection model.

### Examples

After training the object detection model using Teachable Machine, deploy and use the model for real-time object detection in your own applications:

            const model = await cocoSsd.load();
            const image = document.getElementById('input-image');
            const predictions = await model.detect(image);
            console.log(predictions);
        }
    </script>

    <h1>Object Detection Demo</h1>
    <input type="file" accept="image/*" onchange="document.getElementById('input-image').src = URL.createObjectURL(this.files[0])">
    <button onclick="runObjectDetection()">Detect Objects</button>
    <img id="input-image" src="" style="max-width: 500px;">
</body>
</html>
```
